# Age-Calculator
Program to calculate the age of an individual

### Problem statement
Write a file which will take the date of birth of an individual and the current date in dd/mm/yyyy format as inputs, and output the exact age in years, months and days. The program will not accept invalid dates like 31/02/2022 or 15/19/2022. If invalid dates are entered, the program should display an error message.

After calculating the age, the program will give the user two choices-

1. Continue
2. Exit
The program will keep on accepting inputs from the user until the user chooses to exit.

#### Assumptions
The input will always be in dd/mm/yyyy format. Assume that February always has 28 days. The other months have 30 or 31 days depending upon the considered month.

### Example
The sample inputs and their corresponding expected outputs are shown in the file "console.txt".
